%\begin{minipage}[t]{1\textwidth}
%	\vspace{-\baselineskip} % Required for vertically aligning minipages
%I am a senior software developer and technical team leader currently working
%at Zharfpouyan.
%Developing and enhancing the core capabilities of the operating system,
%including kernel network stack,
%Designing and implementing (mostly network-based) software solutions, and managing
%technical teams to achieve the project goals is one of my responsibilities.
%\\
%\\
%I like simple solutions over complex designs and I believe that any solution
%can be the base of another problem at some future. So keeping the design simple and
%keeping the code away from the unnecessary complexity is the key to have a
%maintainable and scalable product. So I like BSD projects more due to it's cleaner
%code and design and I like to be part of anything happening around such great projects.
