\begin{minipage}[t]{1\textwidth}

I am a senior system developer and team leader currently working
as the Project development manager at Zharfpouyan, managing development
of Zharf-Router project (An IP/IPv6/MPLS/QoS enabled router).
Developing and enhancing the core capabilities of the operating system,
including kernel funcationality and kernel network stack programming,
designing and implementing software network-based solutions, and managing
technical teams to achieve the project goals at the Zharf router project is
part of my daily routine jobs.
\\
\\
I like simple solutions over complex designs and I believe that any solution
can be part of another problem at some future. So keeping the design simple and
keeping the code away from the unnecessary complexity is the key to have a
maintainable and scalable product. So I like BSD projects more due to it's cleaner
code and design and I like to be part of anything happening around such great projects.

		Detailed Achievements:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Extending BSD kernel's network Stack, adding new protocols
			      and features like customized MPLS network stack,
			      MPLS-TE tunnels, L2TPv3 tunnels, MPLS L2/L3 VPNs,
			      mGRE tunnels and many more.
			\item Porting Intel NIC drivers, extending driver support.
			\item Implementing new or Improving existing network routing
			      protocol daemons like RSVP, OSPF, LDP, etc.
			\item Design and re-implementation of a new Infrastructure for
				  core projects. Introducing one step builds, Regression tests,
				  Embeded sulutions And implementing Faster, more secure boot
				  process and more.
			\item Designing the infrastructure to keep and maintain technical and
				  non-technical documentations powered by LaTex system and
				  git versioning system.
			\item Extending automated tests to any appliance network devices,
				  even telephony services like VOIP devices.
			\item Defining an acceptable level of technical knowledge for
			      developers and designing educational courses to prepare
			      new comers adapting project's standards.
